Axon is a unified AI-assisted development environment that solves context loss, wheel reinvention, and planning chaos in AI-powered programming. **Powered by [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) and [OhMyOpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)**, Axon orchestrates these powerful tools through specification-driven development and task management.

## ✨ Why Axon?

**Axon transforms AI from a "Code Autocompleter" into a "Development Partner".**

- **🧠 Spec-First**: Don't just chat. Define requirements in `spec.md` to keep the AI focused.
- **🗺️ Bead Planning**: Complex features are broken into atomic, dependency-sorted tasks (Beads).
- **🔄 Full Flow**: One-click orchestration from requirements to verification using `ax flow run`.
- **🔌 IDE Ready**: Integrate with Cursor/Trae/VSCode via **MCP** (Model Context Protocol).
- **🤖 Agentic Execution**: **OpenCode** agents execute tasks one-by-one, ensuring context and quality.
- **🛡️ Quality Guard**: Automated `run_checks` and generated `VERIFY.md` reports for every milestone.
- **♻️ Skill Reuse**: Automatically apply proven patterns (e.g., "Secure Auth") from your team's library.
- **📚 Document Integration**: Import PDF/Word/MD docs as context for AI to generate specs and code using `ax docs`.
- **🚀 Skill Orchestration**: Automatically detect tech stacks (React, Go, PHP) and suggest relevant expertise.
- **🛡️ Enterprise Safe**: Path sandboxing, Git safety checks, and multi-provider failover via **OMO**.

## 🎯 Applicable Scenarios

Axon is best suited for:

- **Complex Feature Implementation**: When a feature requires multiple file changes and architectural consistency (e.g., "Add JWT Auth").
- **Greenfield Projects**: Starting a new project with clear requirements and strictly following a spec.
- **Large-Scale Refactoring**: Systematically updating code patterns across a codebase.
- **Team Standardization**: Enforcing consistent coding standards and capabilities across a team using shared Skill templates.

It is **NOT** designed for:
- Simple, one-line code completions (Use Copilot/Cursor).
- Real-time syntax error fixing (Use IDE linters).

## 🆚 Tool Comparison

Note: capabilities vary by product version and configuration; this table reflects common defaults and emphasis.

Also note the abstraction level:
- **Axon** is a workflow/orchestration layer (spec, planning graph, execution, verification).
- **OpenCode** is the underlying agent execution engine.
- **OhMyOpenCode (OMO)** is the provider layer for connecting to different LLM backends/accounts.

| Feature | Axon | GitHub Copilot / Cursor | Aider / OpenDevin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Philosophy** | **Spec/Plan/Work/Verify** (workflow-first) | **IDE assistant** (chat + completions) | **Agent-driven coding** (chat + patches/tools) |
| **Context Awareness** | **Persisted artifacts** (`.openspec` + `.beads`) | **Workspace context** (open files + index/RAG, varies) | **Repo context** (repo map/tools, varies) |
| **Planning** | ✅ **Explicit task graph** (Beads) | ⚠️ **Ad-hoc** (chat planning; no shared graph by default) | ⚠️ **Tool-dependent** (can follow plans; some have planning) |
| **Human Control** | ✅ **High** (reviewable docs/graph + git safety) | ✅ **High** (accept/reject + manual edits) | ⚠️ **Mode-dependent** (git-based review; autonomy optional) |
| **Cost Control** | ✅ **Usage tracking** (limits if configured/provider supports) | ⚠️ **Provider/subscription** (quotas vary) | ⚠️ **Provider-dependent** (budgets need explicit guardrails) |
| **Knowledge Reuse** | ✅ **Skills templates** (`.skills`) | ⚠️ **Rules/prompts** (workspace/user; less structured) | ⚠️ **Prompts/scripts** (reuse possible; tool-dependent) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First-time LLM setup (Recommended)

Axon can run in different LLM modes depending on your workflow:
- **IDE-owned LLM**: run `ax mcp --llm off` and let Cursor/Trae handle model calls (Axon focuses on spec/plan/verify artifacts).
- **OMO + OpenCode CLI**: install/configure OMO, then run `ax config test` and (optionally) `ax config set-model <model> -p <provider>` to persist project defaults in `.axon/config.yaml`.
- **Fallback (env vars)**: set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY`), then run `ax config test --mode fallback`.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g @arrislink/axon

# Or use with bunx
bunx @arrislink/axon init my-project
```

### Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arrislink/axon.git
cd axon

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Link locally for global access
npm link

# Verify installation
ax --help
```

### Initialize Your First Project

```bash
# Create a new project
ax init my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# Create specification interactively (or from docs)
ax docs add-dir ./docs          # Scan and import all documents
ax spec init                    # AI uses imported docs to generate spec
ax spec analyze                 # Refine spec into professional PRD.md

# Generate task graph from spec
ax plan
...
...
# Check project status
ax status
```

## ✅ Best Practices (Short)
- Prefer `ax flow run` for a deterministic Spec → Plan → Work → Verify loop.
- Use `ax mcp --llm off` for IDE-first workflows; use `--llm auto` for automation.
- Keep `.openspec/` and `.beads/` committed for team/CI repeatability.

## ⚙️ Configuration

For a first-time setup checklist, see [GUIDE.md](./docs/GUIDE.md).

### LLM Provider Configuration

Axon integrates with [OhMyOpenCode (OMO)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) for seamless multi-provider support:

```bash
# Configure OMO (optional for enhanced features)
bunx oh-my-opencode install
omo config set-provider antigravity

# Axon automatically detects and uses OMO configuration
ax plan  # Uses configured provider
```

**Provider Priority:**
1. **CLI Mode** - Uses OpenCode CLI (inherits full OMO capabilities)
2. **Direct Mode** - Reads OMO config and resolves **Antigravity** tokens automatically
3. **Fallback Mode** - Uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` etc. environment variables

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required (fallback mode)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional (additional providers)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

### Project Configuration

Edit `.axon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0"

project:
  name: "my-project"
  description: "Project description"

agents:
  sisyphus:
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    provider: "anthropic"
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 8000

safety:
  daily_token_limit: 1000000
  cost_alert_threshold: 10.0
  auto_pause_on_error: true
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Axon is built on a modular architecture that separates requirement definition, task planning, and agentic execution.

```mermaid
graph TD
    User([User CLI]) --> Commands[Axon Commands: init, spec, plan, work]
    
    subgraph "Axon Engine"
        Commands --> Spec[OpenSpec Manager]
        Spec --> Beads[Beads Engine: Graph Gen & Execution]
        Beads --> Skills[Skills Library: Matching & Injection]
        Skills --> Orch[Agent Orchestrator]
    end
    
    subgraph "LLM Layer"
        Orch --> LLMInt[Unified LLM Interface]
        LLMInt --> OMO[OMO Config & Antigravity Auth]
        OMO --> Providers[Providers: Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.]
    end
```

### Core Components:

1.  **OpenSpec Manager**: Parses and manages the specification (`.openspec/spec.md`). It ensures the AI always has a "Source of Truth" for requirements.
2.  **Beads Engine**: 
    *   **Planning**: Converts specifications into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of atomic tasks.
    *   **Execution**: Manages task dependencies, state persistence (`graph.json`), and sequential execution.
3.  **Skills Library**: A repository of reusable code patterns. It automatically matches relevant skills to tasks and injects them into the agent's context.
4.  **Agent Orchestrator**: Coordinates specialized AI agents (like the general-purpose "Sisyphus") to execute specific beads.
5.  **Unified LLM Interface**: A vendor-neutral abstraction layer that integrates with **OhMyOpenCode** to provide multi-provider failover and consistent API access.
